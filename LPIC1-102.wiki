== Customize and use the shell environment ==
=== Setting Up the Shell Environment ===
Two main types of shell environments
Interactive Login Shell
log into a console
log in via SSH Interactive non-login shell
Local terminal

Interactive login shell
First thing after logging in
/etc/profile gets read
Calls /etc/profile.d/*
Calls .bash_profile/.profile
Calls .bashrc
Calls /etc/bashrc
Console shows

Interactive non-login shell
Calls .bashrc
Calls /etc/bashrc

How can you tell which one you're in?
echo $0
Shows name of process currently running
-bash
dash indicates a login shell

No dash in non-login shell

/etc/profile
First file read
Sets up system-wide environment variables, umask, history controls etc.
Modifications should be made in profile.d/

/etc/profile.d/
Contains extra configurations for bash

/etc/bashrc
Configure system-wide functions and aliases here

/etc/skel
Contains the default .bash_profile, .bashrc and other files added to a user's
home directory. Added to new user home folders
bash_logout
Empty by default
can add logout messages or commands to force an application to quit

home .bashrc will call system level bashrc

.bash_login, old bash_profile. Largely replaced
Legacy file

=== Customizing the Shell Environment ===
Bash Customization Commands
env
View environment variables for the current shell
All enviromental variables listed

export
Command used to allow child shell session to use an environment variable

set
By itself displays all Bash shell settings
Can also be used to enable/disable BASH settings

set -f, disable file globbing
set +f, enable file globbing

unset
Remove an environment variable

unset VARABLE, do not use $

alias
Used to create a shortcut to longer command

function
Customer command any user can use in a shell

function FUNCTION() {
> ENTER FUNCTION COMMANDS
}

Make function permanent
Add to .bashrc
function FUNCTION() {
  FUNCTION
}

. (dot)
Command used to source or apply function from a file into the current BASH session
or shell script

source
same as .
I typically do 'source .zshrc' to pull in new zsh settings

PATH
location paths separated by ':'
create bin directory in home folder
Move scripts there
Can run them directly from there

Add to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/filepath/to/add
^^ Be careful or you'll overwrite PATH

echo $PATH
confirm new path added

Make it permanent in .bash_profile
PATH=$PATH:/FILEPATH/TO/ADD
Can use $HOME

=== Hands-On Lab: Modifying the BASH Shell ===
Create the alias.
The first step is to create an alias for the Bash shell that will allow you to
view the service status of the web server itself. You will name this alias webstat.
When you type the command webstat at the prompt, you will see the output of the
command systemctl status httpd.service.

User-created aliases and functions should go in your local ~/.bashrc file.
Using the commands listed, append the following alias to your ~/.bashrc file:

echo 'alias webstat="systemctl status httpd.service"' >> /home/cloud_user/.bashrc

Load and test the alias.
Now that we have created an alias that displays the status of the web server, we
need to tell Bash that we want to use it in our current session. First, we need
to source our .bashrc file using the “dot” (.) command:

. ~/.bashrc
Now that the Bash environment has been refreshed with the new alias from
our ~/.bashrc file, we can use our new alias:

webstat
We should be able to see the output of our service's status command.

Create your function.
The next step is to create a function that will take the name of a directory as a
parameter and print out how much disk space that directory is using.

Using the vi text editor, open up the ~/.bashrc file and add the following
function to the bottom, beneath the alias that you created earlier:

function webspace()
{
    du -h /var/www/html/$1;
}
Save and close your file. Then source the .bashrc file again:

. .bashrc

Use the `webspace` function.
Since the /var/www/html directory is the root location for all of the individual
site locations for this web server, all you need to do is provide the name of the
folder that contains a particular part of the site to the webspace function.
To view the size and contents of the main public web page, enter this command:

webspace main
This will print out the contents of the /var/www/html/main directory and how much
disk space this directory uses. The $1 used in your function is a positional
argument. When you type webspace main at the prompt, the word main is replaced by
the $1 argument, thus providing the output of the command for the
/var/www/html/main directory.

Try the same command again, this time for the customer directory on the web server:

webspace customer
You should see more directories in the output, plus a 5 MB client binary file.

== Customize or write simple scripts ==
=== Basic Shell Scripts ===
Reduce repetitive work
old saying: If you have to type it more than once put it in a script
Useful for automated tasks
task with no input

#! shebang
^^ #!/usr/bin/bash, #!/usr/bin/python
Don't need file extension if you use shebang
I personally use the shebang + the extension to be thorough

#, comment

Scripts need execute permissiosn

Parameters

Positiional arguments/parameters
script option1 option2
$1 = option1
$2 = option2

=== Adding Logic to you shell scripts ===
if Statements
if, else, elseif, fi
test command is used to test for various conditions
|| OR
&& AND
!= Not equal

test command can be used for simpler statements
Remember that you'll need double brackets for OR statements
Alternatively
[ CONDITIONAL ] || [ CONDITIONAL ]

Be aware of logical errors

Testing integers
-eq equlity between two numbers, is the same
-ne inequality between two numbers, is not the same
-gt If one number is higher than another
-lt If one number is lower than another
-ge If one number greater than or equal to another
-le If one number less than or equal to another

Return last value
$?

Returns 0 in most cases, generally greater than 0 is a failure

Can check for output
if [ $? -gt 0 ]; then

=== Bash Loops and sequences ===
for, loop over a fixed number of times
while, loop until a condition is false
until, loops and stops when condition true

sequence
seq x, increment from 1 -> x by 1

seq x y, increment from x -> y by 1

seq x y z, increment from x -> z by y

until [ $var -t 1 ]
do
	LOOP STUFF
	$var=var-1
done

read, takes input from user
exit, returns 0 by default.

Can specify a different exit code
exit VALUE
confirm echo $?

exec,
redirect output into another file/process without sending to current shell

exec > out.log
ls
pwd
cat out.log

== Install and configure X11 ==
=== The basics of X11 ===
Provides graphical rendering for UNIX-like operating systems
Core display serer that provides protocol service for X window system
Extension:
RandR, dynamic resizing of the root window, refresh rates, mirroring displays
GLX, provides rendering of 3d opengl conten within windows
Xinerama: provides the ability to split the desktop across multiple monitors

Basic building blocks
Graphics care -> Linux Kernel and Graphics Driver -> libDRM -> Xserver -> Xlib/XCB
-> Display Manager -> Application
X-server -> /etc/X11/xorg.conf, /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d

Good to practice with older EOL distro
X is different now
Will need to know how to work on newer/older versions of X11

Wayland
Meant to replace X Window System
Simpler rendering protocol
Xwayland, enables X window client to render with Wayland for backwards compatability

=== Installing X11 ===
Example uses EOL CentOS 5
yum grouplist
yum groupinstall "X Window System" -y
telinit to change runlevel (older)
Need to be in runlevel 5
Never use X session as root user

By default uses gdm/twm

Window Manager provides look/feel of desktop
Start window manager without going through gdm

Go to runlevel 4, telinit4
startx, starts window manager for you
Not secure, running window manager while logged in as root user
Bypass password prompt
startx, works as your user too
Security risk

Older system
cat /etc/inittab
Bottom of file
x:5:respawn:/etc/X11/prefdm -nodaemon

Available display managers listed
echo $DISPLAY
:0.0
First 0 which X server
On remote machines it's assigned the number 1
. separates which X server from which screen
Different numbers for different screens

=== X11 Configurations ===
/etc/X11/xorg.conf
Primary configuration file used for the X Display Server.
use man xorg.conf for a full listing of all options

X (Xorg)
Used to create a new configuration file for your X server

xdpyinfo
Displays information about the current X session and X server instance.

/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
Directotry that contains supplementary Xorg configuration files

Input device lists options for Keyboard type and layout

Device is for GPU

Screen is for GPU/Monitor

Some systems create a symbolic link between X -> Xorg command
runlevel 3 is good to use, X prefers to not have a running server

Back up existing conf file
X -configure

X -config /root/xorg.conf.new to test new config
To quit use control + alt + backspace
Copy new config file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
Jump to runlevel 5

xdpyinfo | less to review output
name of display, as well as version
enabled extensions
number of screens + Default screen
Screen dimensions

Virtualbox doesn't work well with custom X server options
Modes option under SubSection "Display" can be used to increase resolution
Put higher resolutions before lower resolution, to fall back
Make change to 16/24 bit color depths

In order for changes to take effect reboot system

Modern Linux distros usually don't use a centralized conf file
^^ I don't even think Slackware does

Newer distros use xorg.conf.d
Begin with two digits
00, 09, 10 etc.
Loaded in order

ls /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
Other conf files
Modern X11 is better at detecting what's plugged in and configured

=== Remote Graphical Connections ===
Ability to allow remote displays

xhost
Older and insecure method of allowing client systems theability to display
remote X11 windows

Remote display connections disabled by default
xhost +, enable
xhost -, disable

ip addr show
inet IP

xhost + IP

ssh -Y USER@IP, forward X11 request
Set up display environment
export DISPLAY"127.0.0.1:10.0"
Tell system to display windows on localhost
Using ssh daemon on remote system use 10.0
Confirm with xclock/xeyes

xauth
Allows a user to edit and view security information that grants a user the ability
to control remote X11 client windows

xauth list
Shows what sessions are running currently

VNC
Virtual Network Computing enables a remote computer to control the graphical display
of a remote system. Insecure by default

Tiger VNC server
yum -y install tigervnc-server
copy over unit file
cp /usr/systemd/vncserver@.server /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@:1.service
Assign it it's own unique number
Configure service to work with account
Edit copied file
Scroll to bottom
:%s/<USER>/user/g
Edited systemd file, reload daemon
systemd daemon-reload
Set VNC password for local user
vncpasswd command
^^ Service will fail otherwise
has to be at least 6 characters long
Use modified unit name when starting service
Enable service
Two ways to connect

Insecure
port 5900
ss -tlpn | grep vnc
Shows vnc listening on port 5901
Need to open port 5901 in firewall
firewall-cmd --permanent --ad-port=5901/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload

Go to desktop, use remote connection software vinegar
Protocol VNC
Host IP:PORT
Connect, enter VNC password
All network traffic is not encrypted
Session can be hijacked
Re-do but with encrypted SSH tunnel

Secure
Close VNC port on remote
firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=5901/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload

On client
ssh -C -L 5901:localhost:5901 IP
Redirect from 5901:localhost to IP:5901
Once that's running to VNC app

Protocol VNC
Host localhost:5901
Enter VNC password


SPICE
TLS encrypted remote desktop protocol (RDP) that can be used in Linux, Windows and
Android systems.

Protocol SPICE

Two way audio
Can also use USB on remote system

== Graphical Desktops ==
=== The primary Linux Desktop Environments ===

GNOME, XFCE, LXDE

QT based desktop
Qt is a 'C++' language library
Desktops that use this library
KDE, LXQT

== Accessibility ==
=== Assistive Technologies on the Linux Desktop ===
Uses GNOME

Visual Alerts
Screen will blink when alert displays
Can use screen keyboard

This is literally just covering the Universal Access section on Gnome...

== Manage User and Group Accounts and related system files ==
=== Adding and Removing Users ===
useradd
useradd command is for the creation of new user accounts on a Linux system

useradd -m -c "COMMENT" -s  /path/to/shell USERNAME
Create user + home directory with a comment, specify default shell
Not all distros require this. Don't forget to set the password for the new user

passwd
passwd commands is for setting a password for a specfic user, can also be used
by a user to change their own password

passwd -e USER
Set current password as OTP for user

userdel
userdel command removes a user's account from the system.
Without the -r option the user's home directory will not be removed

number in place of the username
UID

=== Adding and Removing Groups ===
groups USERNAME
show user what groups user is a member of

groupadd GROUP
Create a new group on the system

User can be added to a group during creation
useradd -G GROUP -m USERNAME
^^ Make sure group exists
-g pertains to user's primary group

groupdel GROUP
Removes a group from the system.
Users in the group will still exist

=== User and Group Configuration Files ===
/etc/passwd
Flat file database that contains info on user and system accounts

/etc/shadow
Contains encrypted passwords for accounts listed in /etc/passwd file

/etc/group
Contains group definitions along with what members belong to each group

Red Hat systems, root has UID of 0
Service users are usually less than 1000
Server users are usually over 1000

/etc/passwd
$#$ - password encryption type
$1$ = MD5
$2a$, $2y$ = Blowfish
$5$ = SHA-256
$6$ = SHA-512
Following encryption algorithm is the salt
^^ Looked it up, it is indeed called salt...

Finally is hashed password.

Main configuration Files

/etc/skel
Special directory that contains ite3ms that automatically get added to a new user's
home directory.

/etc/default/useradd
Configuration file is referenced with a new user account is created

getent
Command is used to query a database for information about a user or group

HOME=/home
default home creation
INACTIVE=-1
Prevents user from accessing with an expired password
SHELL, set default shell
GROUP=100
Defaults to 1000
getent group 100
users:x:100:
Old users default group

/etc/login.defs
Takes precedence over default useradd file

=== User and Group Modifications ===
usermod
modify an existing user account

usermod -a -G GROUP USER
^^ Capitals matter

chage
list and modify the aging parameters of a user's password

groupmod
modify attributes of an existing group, such as name, group ID, etc.

groupmod -g GROUPID GROUP
Change groups group id

groupmod -n GROUP
give group a new name

=== Hands-On Lab: Creating Users And Groups and Managing User Accounts ===
Create a Shared Directory Called /test_scripts
Create a directory called /test_scripts.

Users Added to the System
Add four user accounts to the system that will be used for working on the test
scripts.

Add Users to a Common Group
Add the four new users to the testers group already created on the system.

Set Appropriate Group Ownership and Permissions
The group testers needs to own the /test_scripts directory so that the new users
can all share it. Additionally, the owner and group permissions should be read,
write, and execute, but there should be no privileges for anyone else.


== Automate system administration tasks by scheduling jobs ==
=== Cron ===
crontab used to view and edit a cron table file

/etc/cron.hourly
/etc/cron.daily
/etc/cron.weekly
/etc/cron.monthly

/etc/cron.d
Directory that contains cron jobs for the system

/etc/conf.deny
User listed in this file will be prevented from using crontabs
^ Petition to add a certain client's dev...

man 4 crontabs
Local documentation for crontab files and their formats

minute hour dayOfMonth month dayOfWeek command
* * * * * /usr/bin/bash /root/scripts/whatever.sh

*/15 * * * * command
^ Run every 15 minutes

On own file enter user
USER command
Optional, but best practice
Remember to use full paths, runs in it's own shell

crontab -r, clear cron

=== At ===
What if you just want to run a single command?
Usually not installed by default

at
run a one time job

atq
View job queue

atrm
Remove a job using it's job number

at.allow/deny
Allow/deny users the ability to run jobs

Opens in a shell
at now + 5 minutes
at 4:00 AM tomorrow
COMMAND
<EOT> = End of Transmissions
ctrl + d = EOT

Remove job,
atrm JOBID

Run a script
at -f PATH/TO/SCRIPT TIME PM MONTH DAY

=== Systemd Timer Unit Files ===
Timer units,
end in .timer extension
Need a service file to go with it

Another type of timer doesn't have a file
monotonic and realtime
monotonic are designed to run after a tiem has passed
Can repeat as long as system is running
Timers deleted
Directive, OnBootSec=, OnActiveSec=
Realtime, OnCalendar= Uses calendar function

Why not use cron/at?
Simpler syntax (lol)

Transient Timers:
Set up by systemd-run command, do not require a service file
Like At jobs
[Timer] Section
Monotonic OnBootSec=,OnUnitSecActiveSec=
Realtime OnCalendar=
Unit=
Some timer unit files enabled with
[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
man 5 systemd.timer
man 7 systemd.time

Commands
systemctl list-timers --all
List all timers on a system

systemctl cat <foo.timer>
Review the contens of a timer unit file

systemd-run --on-active=
Create a transient timer, that does not require a service file

Timer units will have a [Unit] section as well

Basic Syntax,
[Unit]
Description=

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* HH:MM:SS
^Y-M-D
Resistent=true
Unit=whatever.service
Set to rerun,

[Install]
WantedBy=

Then enable/start


=== Hands-on Lab: Scheduling a systemd service job with timer units ===
During the time that your development team has spent working on the new web-based
API for your organization, there have been several instances of mistaken keystrokes
or processes that have necessitated the restoration of the site directory from backup.

You have been asked to run periodic backups of the website directory and, given that
the development environment does not have access to the backup network, you have
decided to write a custom service that will do so.

You have previously written the systemd unit files to back up the site.
You have been provided a file called web-backup.sh in your /root directory
(NOTE: you will need to become the root user to complete your work).
Using that file and the associated web-backup.service, create a systemd timer unit
file that will control the schedule of your service.

After you have all three components ready, stage the files in their appropriate
locations and start the service for your team and turn it back over for their use.

￼
Create a Service Timer Unit File
Follow the scenario to create the appropriate timer unit file.

￼
Putting Files Where They Belong
Copy the service and timer files and the shell script into the correct locations.

￼
Run the Custom Service
Once the backup service has been created successfully from the scenario,
make sure it is running so the backup will happen as scheduled.

== Localization and Internationalization ==

Example Polish language uses iso88592

LANG=C
Use C language environment
Useful consistent results across systems
Blocks are stand in characters

file -i FILE will show encoding
look for charset

inconv -f encodingFrom -t encodingTo -o outFile inFile

Permanently set LANG variable
localectl set-locale ENCODING

=== Time and Date on the Linux System ===

=== Introduction to the systemd journal ===
Binary file that records everything that happens on a system
Kernel log messages
System log messages, same as syslog
System services that sent output to standard output and standard error
Audit records for SELinux messages

Default log at /run/log/journal
Doesn't persist on reboot

To make permanent:
mkdir -p /var/log/journal
systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal

Journal configuration
man 5 journald.conf
/etc/systemd/journald.conf
[Journal]
Storage=
auto, default. Stores data to /var/log/journal (if it exists) and /run/log/journal
persistent, data is stored to /var/log/journal hierarchy
volatile, data is only sent to /run/log/journal, resides in RAM
none, no data is kept, all log data is dropped

Compress=
Takes a Boolean value
yes, the default. Any data above a threshold are compressed
no, no data is compressed

SystemMaxUse=, RuntimeMaxUse=
How much RAM/disk space to use.
Default is 10%

SystemMaxFileSize=, RuntimeMaxFilesSize=
SystemMaxFileSize pertains to how large individual journal files may get. May have more than one journal file on system.
RuntimeMaxFileSize pertains to how large individual files can get while in RAM
Sizes can be in bytes of K, M, G, T, P or E

MaxRetentionSec=

Not all log entries will have explanatory text available.

-k
Show only kernel messages
Similar to dmesg command

-b
Shows all the journal entries that have been collected since them ost recent system boot up.

--list-boots
Show list of recorded boot sessions.
Journal must be persistent for this to be useful.

--since,--until
Show entries new than or until a date and time.
Date follows YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format
00:00:00 implied if no time passed.
Also uses text like "yesterday", "today", or "now".

Displays the amount of disk space that the journal is consuming.

--rotate
Rotate the journal files.

=== Hands-on Lab: Working with System Service Log Files using the journal control ===
Introduction

Troubleshooting is an important part of working with services through systemd.
In this hands-on lab, we will learn how to view system service log files using the Journal Control utility.
At the end of this hands-on lab, you will know how to use the built-in journalctl utility to view and troubleshoot system services.

Check the status of the web service.
systemctl status httpd.service

Attempt to start the web service.
systemctl start httpd.service

After the service fails to start, check the journal.
journalctl -u httpd.service

Check the directory where the httpd configuration file should be.
ls /etc/httpd/conf

Restore the original httpd configuration file.
mv /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.bkup /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Restart the service.
systemctl restart httpd.service

Verify That the Web Server Service Is Running

Check the status of the service.
systemctl status httpd.service

Navigate to the local web page.
